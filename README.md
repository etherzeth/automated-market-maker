This project is a demonstration of a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built to showcase my expertise in developing secure, efficient, and well-structured smart contracts. It serves as a proof of concept highlighting my skills in blockchain development, decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanisms, and smart contract optimization.
